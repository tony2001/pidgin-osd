Introduction
============

'pidgin-osd' is an application to print events on the X root screen
on recieving incoming messages from pidgin. It uses the xosd
library to print various events on the X console.

'pidgin-osd' is based on the gaimnosd 0.7 version, the last public
available one. I created this plugin because at time of compiling
pidgin there was no working osd plugin available.

Manual

It is a good idea to read the `FAQ' file.
